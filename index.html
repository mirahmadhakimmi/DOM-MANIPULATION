        <h1>Why do people love games?</h1>
        <p>
            As the game maker for the NEW-YORK times,i grapple with this question every day.the reductively easy answer is simple.
            Games occupy a strange place in our cultural consciousness. Nearly everyone has played a game at some point in their lives.
            Despite that ubiquity, games are rarely discussed with the same reverence as other media like films or books. For most,
            games are like chocolate: a guilty pleasure consumed secretly. The game designer Sid Meier once remarked that “a game is
            a series of interesting choices.” Navigating these choices shapes the course of play, revealing who we are and how we think.
            Playing a game is an act of exposition.
